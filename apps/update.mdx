## Best Practices

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Version Control">
    ### Track Your Changes
    
    Maintain a version history for your app:
    
    ```lua Example Version Tracking
    -- In your app's main module
    local AppInfo = {
        Name = "MyAwesomeApp",
        Version = "1.2.0",
        LastUpdated = "2025-10-26",
        Changes = {
            "Fixed crash when opening settings",
            "Added dark mode support",
            "Improved performance by 30%"
        }
    }
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) to communicate the type of update.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Changelog">
    ### Communicate Updates

    - **Patch updates** (1.0.1) - Bug fixes and small improvements
    
    Post changelogs in your Discord or app documentation.
