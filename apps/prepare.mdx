<Info>
Preparation is the process of compiling all your app components into a single encrypted package ready for publishing.
</Info>

## Overview

When you've finished testing every functionality of your app and it works great, you can proceed with preparing. This step compiles all components into a distributable format suitable for:

- **Publishing** to the Exe 6 App Library
- **External distribution** as a downloadable app

## Preparation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Preparation Page">
    Go to **Apps** in Exe 6 and select **Prepare** to access the Preparation Page
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select App Components">
    Choose all components that make up your app:
    
    <Accordion title="Component Types">
      - **Scripts** - All Lua scripts and logic
      - **UIs** - User interface elements and screens
      - **Events** - Event handlers and triggers
      - **Objects** - Additional game objects and assets
    </Accordion>
    
    <Tip>
    The "Prepare" button displays how many components you've selected
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Compile Your App">
    Click the **Prepare** button to start the compilation process
    
    This will:
    - Compile all selected app components
    - Encrypt their data for security
    - Store them in the `Exe6Folder` for distribution
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Output Structure

After preparation, your app will be compiled into the following structure:

<CodeGroup>

```text Folder Structure
Exe6Folder/
├── [YourAppName]
│   ├── Compiled components
│   ├── Encrypted data
│   └── Metadata
```

```lua Component Example
-- Your scripts are compiled and encrypted
-- Original structure is preserved
local YourApp = {}

function YourApp:Initialize()
    -- App initialization logic
end

return YourApp
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Ensure all components are properly tested before preparing. Once compiled, the components are encrypted and cannot be easily modified.
</Warning>

## The Exe6Folder

The `Exe6Folder` is the container for your prepared app:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Encrypted & Secure" icon="lock">
    All app data is encrypted to protect your code
  </Card>
  <Card title="Distribution Ready" icon="box">
    Ready to upload to Roblox or share externally
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Next Steps

Once your app components are prepared, you can proceed to publishing:

<Card title="Publish Your App" icon="rocket" href="/apps/publish">
  Learn how to upload your prepared app to Roblox
</Card>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Component selection not showing">
    Make sure all your app components are properly placed in your Exe 6 workspace and are not inside restricted folders.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Prepare button is disabled">
    You must select at least one component before the Prepare button becomes active.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Compilation fails">
    Check that none of your components have syntax errors or missing dependencies. Test each component individually before preparing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
